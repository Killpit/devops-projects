# Volumes

- Preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.
- Easier to back up or migrate than bind mounts.
- Can be managed using Docker CLI commands or the Docker API.
- Work both on Linux and Windows containers.
- More safely shared among multiple containers.
- Lets you store volumes on remote hosts or cloud providers, encrypt the contents of volumes, or add other functionality.
- Can have their content pre-populated by a container.
- Have much higher performance than bind mounts from Mac and Windows hosts.
- Better choice than persisting data in a container's writable layer because a volume doesn't increase the size of the containers using it, and the volume's contents exist outside the lifecycle of a given container.

## Bind Mounts

- File or directory on the host machine is mounted into a container. 
- File or directory is referenced by its absolute path on the host machine.
- Rely on the host machine's filesystem having a specific directory structure available.

## Differences Between Volumes and Bind Mounts

- Bind mounts rely on the host machine's filesystem having a specific directory structure available while volumes can be stored in a container
- Volumes are better suited for more complex use cases while bind mounts are suited for simple use cases.
